Help for GENDER:

GENDER sets or clears gender identify information associated with
your account, which will be visible in your WHOIS and &nick& INFO
information. The information you enter will be prefixed with "identifies as"
when displayed; do not enter this part.

Using GENDER without a description clears gender identity information.

Syntax: GENDER [DESCRIPTION]

Examples of setting gender identity information:
    /msg &nick& GENDER female
    /msg &nick& GENDER gender non-conforming

For the above, a /WHOIS would show:
ExampleUser1 identifies as: female
ExampleUser2 identifies as: gender non-conforming

Example of clearing gender information:
    /msg &nick& GENDER
