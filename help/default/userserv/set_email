Help for SET EMAIL:

SET EMAIL changes the e-mail address
associated with an account. The e-mail
address is used for password retrieval.

You may be required to confirm the new
e-mail address. To confirm the address,
follow the instructions in the message
sent to the new address.

If the network has allowed you to not 
supply an email address, you may use the 
word noemail instead of your email address 
to indicate that you do not wish to associate
one with your account.

Syntax: SET EMAIL <new address>

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET EMAIL dan@example.com
