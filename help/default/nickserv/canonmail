Help for CANONMAIL:

CANONMAIL takes an email address and looks up the
canonicalized form.

This is an internal representation of the email address
used in registration limit checks; two addresses that
canonicalize to the same string will be considered the
same address for purposes of such limits.

Syntax: CANONMAIL <email>

Example:
    /msg &nick& CANONMAIL ilbelkyr@atheme.org
