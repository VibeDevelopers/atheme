 ******************************************************************************/

/*
 * This block controls the configuration options for crypto modules.
 *
 * It is recommended to either leave the values at their defaults, or
 * experiment with them so that it takes approximately 0.2-0.4 seconds
 * for users to identify. Services blocks while the password is being
 * encrypted or verified, so don't set these too large, or people can
 * hang services by trying many password attempts at once.
 *
 * A benchmark program for the Argon2, scrypt & PBKDF2 crypto code is
 * available to assist with tuning these parameters:
 *
 *     - ./configure --prefix=foo ...
 *     - make
 *     - make install
 *     - ${foo}/bin/atheme-crypto-benchmark -o
 *
 * If you wish to deploy SASL SCRAM support, please read 'doc/SASL-SCRAM' and
 * pass the '-i' flag to the included cryptographic benchmarking utility too.
 *
 * If you are using the PBKDF2 module, its performance will be significantly
 * affected by your choice of cryptographic digest library. This software can
 * currently interface with 3 libraries; in decreasing order of performance:
 *
 *     - OpenSSL (libcrypto)
 *     - GnuPG (libgcrypt)
 *     - ARM mbedTLS (libmbedcrypto)
 *
 * If you have one of these libraries available at configure-time, the PBKDF2
 * module will perform significantly better, allowing you to raise its
 * iteration count without affecting the computation time. This is indicated
 * by the output of the configure script; "Digest Frontend". The benchmark
 * program will also inform you what cryptographic digest library it is using,
 * if any.
 *
 *
 *
 * If you are migrating from crypto/argon2d (v7.2) to crypto/argon2, and you
 * wish to use the same parameters as the older module's defaults, configure
 * it like so:
 *
 *     crypto {
 *         argon2_type = "argon2d";
 *         argon2_memcost = 14;
 *         argon2_timecost = 32;
 *         argon2_threads = 1;
 *         argon2_saltlen = 32;
 *         argon2_hashlen = 64;
 *     };
 *
 *
 *
 * If you are migrating from crypto/pbkdf2 (v7.2) to crypto/pbkdf2v2, and you
 * wish to use the same parameters as the older module, configure it like so:
 *
 *     crypto {
 *         pbkdf2v2_digest = "SHA512";
 *         pbkdf2v2_rounds = 128000;
 *     };
 *
 * Note that this will still result in passwords being re-encrypted with the
 * newer module (as the older module successfully verifies them); another new
 * PBKDF2 computation with a new salt will occur, but this is still no worse
 * than an invocation of NickServ's "SET PASSWORD" command. You will still
 * need to keep the old module in your loadmodule configuration above, as the
 * new module cannot verify digests produced by the old one.
 *
 * If you wish to deploy SASL SCRAM support, please read 'doc/SASL-SCRAM'.
 * Its advice regarding parameter choice takes precedence over this!

	/* (*) argon2_type
	 *
	 * The algorithm type to use for new passwords.
	 *
	 * Argon2d is suitable for use on a dedicated machine that has
	 * limited access. It provides the most resistance to GPU and ASIC
	 * cracking attacks, but its operation is data-dependent; that is,
	 * during its operation, keying material derived from the password
	 * itself is indirectly affecting the execution choices made by the
	 * algorithm. This creates a side-channel that can leak information
	 * about the password to other software running on the same physical
	 * machine.
	 *
	 * Argon2i avoids this by being data-independent. The order of memory
	 * accesses, conditional execution, etc. does not depend on the
	 * password, or any material derived from the password, so no side-
	 * channel that can reveal any information about the password is
	 * created. However, this means that it is easier to bruteforce by a
	 * password cracker, which does not have to account for execution
	 * differences in its implementation. This is the most suitable
	 * choice for running on a virtual machine that is co-located with
	 * other, untrusted, virtual machines, or on a dedicated machine that
	 * runs other, untrusted, software, or has untrusted user access.
	 *
	 * Argon2id is a blend of both, limiting the exploitability of any
	 * side-channels while retaining excellent resistance to GPU and ASIC
	 * cracking. This is suitable for all but the most sensitive of
	 * deployments.
	 *
	 * All algorithm types perform about equally as well as each other;
	 * changing this will not significantly affect the computation time.
	 *
